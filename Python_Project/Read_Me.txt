Instructions : 

1. Python Code File - main.py

2. Input File - Input_File.xlsx

3. Output File - Output Data Structure.xlsx

4. Please make sure that there is no already existing folder with the name "Assignment_TextFiles"     in the "D" drive, before running "main.py". This program creates a folder with the name "Assignment_TextFiles" in your "D" drive to save all the text files with the respective URL_ID as their names. Hence, if you are going to run main.py a second time, make sure you delete the folder created from the "D" drive first and then run it.
